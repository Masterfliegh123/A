        <p class="headibout">"Our Associates Have Committed And Verified That This Training Is Important
            And Necessary For Those Seeking To Become Political Consultants"</p>
        <h2 class="subhead">The Role And Purpose Of Political Consultants</h2><hr>
        <p class="info-boy">Political Consultants Specialize In Consulting About Politics For Their Clients. They Perform A Wide Range Of Functions Like Running A Political Campaign, Helping Clients File For Political Candidacy Via Signature Drive And/Or Filing Fee, Helping Or Advising A Client/Candidate Raise Money For Their Potential Election, Advising Or Helping A Candidate File Campaign Finance Forms To Their Filing Authority, And Even Advising Clients On Which Office To Run For In Particular.</p>
        <h2 class="subhead">How To Run For Politics</h2><hr>
        <p class="info-boy">Running For Politics Varies Across Different States, Counties, And Cities'. To Run For A Particular Office You Must File An Application For A Place On The Ballot With The State Party Chair Or The County Party Chair As Necessary With Your Office Sought. You Must Pay A Filing Fee Or Turn In a Petition In Lieu Of A Filing Fee With A Certain Number Of Signatures (500 Signatures For Most County Offices). The Following Link Will Give Such Information <a href="https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/candidates/guide/2022/demorrep2022.shtml">How To Run For Politics In Texas</a> and this link will help you find your counties government website for purposes of political research <a href="https://www.county.org/About-Texas-Counties/Texas-County-Websites">County Government Websites Of Texas</a> Where You May Also Consult Your County Party Chair To Run As It Almost Always Contains Links To All Local Government Offices.</p>
        <h2 class="subhead">How To File The Necessary Forms</h2><hr>
        <p class="info-boy">Filing Financial Statements And Forms For Your Office Are Filed With The Filing Authority Which Could Be Your Local Elections Officer, Or The Texas Ethics Commision. Here A Candidate Or Office Holder Can Find Sources On What You File And Your Potential Filing Authorities <a href="https://www.ethics.state.tx.us/data/resources/guides/coh_local_guide.pdf"> Candidate / Office Holder Local Campaign Finance Guide</a>. Here A Judicial Candidate Or Office Holder Can Find Sources On What You File And Your Potential Filing Authorities <a href="https://www.ethics.state.tx.us/data/forms/coh/JCOH_ins.pdf">Judicial Candidate / Office Holder Local Campaign Finance Guide</a>. Here is The Texas Ethics Commisions' Page on What Document's You File And When <a href="https://www.ethics.state.tx.us/filinginfo/schedules/filing_schedules.php">Filing Schedule For Candidates And Officeholders.</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="subhead">How To Maintain Diplomacy</h2><hr>
        <p class="info-boy">Diplomacy Is The Ability To Conduct Oneself Respectfully In A Way That Harbors A Maintenence For Foreign, Domestic, Or Opposing Parties. Candidates And Officeholders Are To Hold A General Standard Of Respect. Candidates And Officeholders Should Refrain From Mudslinging(ad-hominems etc.). Candidates And Officeholders May Not Always Be Allowed To Endorse Other Candidates And To Understand The Clarity Of These Things You Should Consult A Lawyer To Inform You About The Most Legally Safe Practices. Needless To Say , If You Lack Respect For Differences Even Among Your Opposing Parties You Can Suffer Consequences Whether Legally Or Notably Speaking. Always Be Polite And Respectful. It Is Best Not To Accuse A Politician Of Something Disproven Or Rooted In Conspiracy. If You Have A Concern You Should Speak Of It Without Naming The Perpetrator. If Questioned About The Specifics And Legitimacy Of Your Concern Make Your Argument Without Truly Condemning The Person You Speak Of. The Best Way To Pull This Off Is This Example (Interviewer:"What Do You Mean There Is An Extreme Conflict Between Senator Bendybop And Bowlerland" You:"Well You See Senator Bendybop 'Meets Frequently' With The Government Lobbyists Of Bowlerland And Has Recently Passed Legislation In Favor Solely Of Bowlerland While Recieving A Large Political Donation From The Bowlerland Government. What About This Evidence Doesnt Shout 'I AM BEING BRIBED BY A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT'?"). Notice I Cited Actually Proven Evidence Of 'Senator Bendybop' Potentially Taking Bribes From 'The Bowlerland Government' And Accused Him By Asking A Rhetorical Question 'What Part Of The Evidence Doesnt Shout Im Being Bribed By Bowlerlands Government'. Rhetorical Questions Save You From Directly Accusing Someone And Is Thus In My Personal Opinion Free Mudslinging Rhetoric. Here is another example of diplomacy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy">Diplomacy Source Example</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="subhead">How To Run A Political Campaign</h2><hr>
        <p class="info-boy">Running A Political Campaign Is Easy You Just Need To Understand Where And How To Carry Out Your Tasks. First We Must Ask Where? Well We Need To Pick An Area With Electoral Jurisdiction (Having Proper Residence And Voter Registration To Vote For A Particular Candidate) For The Candidate We Are Campaigning For Like For Example A Person Running For Governor Will Have Voters All Across The State And A County Judge Will Be A County Wide Election And A Commisioner Or Justice Of The Peace Is A Precinct Wide Election. Now We Must Ask How? Well Now You Should Begin Campaigning Now That You Have Established Where You Must Campaign. First You Start By Getting Voter Information In The Area You Are Working Like For State Representatives Or Congress It Would Be Information For That Particular States' District Or If Your Candidate Was Running For Governor It Would Be The Whole State. You Can Request And Pay For Voter Information From The State Itself By Going Through The Texas Secretary Of States' Websites' Public Information Request Area Or Getting The Information On The County Basis From The County Elections Office Or County/District Clerk. Both Of These Resources Can Be Found Here <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/contact.shtml">Public Information Request Secretary Of State Texas</a> And <a href="https://www.county.org/About-Texas-Counties/Texas-County-Websites">Texan Counties List</a>. You Can Also Buy Information On People Within Your Election's Voter Jurisdiction From Businesses That Sell Information. You Can Have Fliers For Your Campaign Printed And Mailed Out To Residences To Inform Voters Of Your Campaign And Alignment. If You Buy Large SMS Lists Or Call Lists It Is Important That Before Attempting To Call Or Text Someone That You <span class="empower">1. Check To Make Sure The Number Is Not In The Federal Do Not Call Registry</span> So That You Do Not Call A Number That Is Legally Forbidden From Being Called And <span class="empower">2. Make Sure The Numbers Listed In The Data That You Purchased Has Spamming Permission By Viewing Their Privacy Policy , Terms And Conditions And By Contacting Them Directly</spam> Also You Must <span class="empower">3. Allow Those That You Text Or Email To Opt Out By Stating The Following "Send Or Reply 'STOP' To This Message To Opt Out Of Receiving Messages From Us Any Longer"</span> Also You Should Always <span class="empower">Consult Legal Advise On Campaigning From An Attorney</span> You Can Also Try Looking Up The Laws And Regulations Yourself Or By Looking At <a href="">NOLO</a> For Law Information</p>
        <h2 class="subhead">How To Advise/Consult Your Clients</h2><hr>
        <p class="info-boy">Political Consultants Can Charge A Lot Of Money Just Explaining Or Leading A Potential Politician/Client Through The Process Of Getting On Ballot For A Political Office. Political Consultants Can Also Locate Resources Required By Their Clients In Their Campaign And Charge Plenty For This Kind Of Work. Political Consultants Can Start A Pre Campaign Signature Drive To Petition For A Client's Ballot(legally and technically running) Access For Their Particular Office. They Can Charge Their Client By The Signature And Make Loads Of Money. Political Consultants Can Also Advise On Which Office To Run For And The Likelyhood And The Effort Necessary To Win. Political Consultants Can Also Learn Things They Do Not Necessarily Know To Best Help Or Suite Their Clients. Political Consultants Can Search Up Statutes In Federal, State ,Or Local Law Because It Is Easy And Just Requires A Little Bit Of Searching On The Browser. Political Consultants Can Teach People About Primary Elections(In Party Election, Democrats v Democrats or Republicans v Republicans) For Each Race And The Preceding General Elections(Out Of Party Elections That Choose Who Is Elected, Party V Party, Democratic Primary Winner v Republican Primary Winner, Democratic Candidate v Republican Candidate) That Elect Candidates Into Office. Quite Simply After The Primary Election Is The General Election That Chooses Who Gets Elected Out Of The Winners Of The Party Elections(Primaries) To A Particular Office. </p>

        <h2 class="subhead">How to Find Proper Resources</h2><hr>
        <p class="info-boy">Many Of The Proper Resources For A Political Consultant Include Voter Data Which Can Be Found Via <a href="">Public Information Request SOS</a> Or You Can Find It By Finding Your County Website And Requesting From Your Local Elections Officer Or County/District Clerks' Office Here <a href="">Texas' Counties' Websites</a>.
